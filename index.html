       <h3><b>Step 1: To Begin is to Succeed</b></h3>
       <p>There’s nothing worse than staring at a blank document on your screen.
       But think how easy it is to conquer that blank page. All you have to do is type one simple sentence.
       This maxim, “To begin is to succeed,” can be applied to every single writing project you take on. While the first sentence you create might not survive your editing process, it’s a start. Before you know it, that first sentence will grow into three, and then into whole paragraphs, and then to a full page.
       Keep in mind that your understanding of the task may be crippling your motivation. You’ll be more likely to procrastinate if the project seems ambiguous, unstructured, lacking in personal meaning, or without any intrinsic value.
       Determine if these or any other triggers might be inhibiting your creative process. Is the task disorganized? Work with your editor or client to gain a clearer understanding. With a revitalized set of expectations, you can begin on your path to success.</p>

       <div class="card">
       <div class="content">
       <h3>Step 2: Gather a Team of Helpers</h3>
       <p>If you’re dreading that paper you have to write, call on a support team. No, not your Facebook friends. Build up a stockpile of both online and interpersonal supports that can be conduits of inspiration or, at least, encouragement.
       These resources will keep you on task and alleviate pressure to finish entirely on your own:
       Hubspot’s Blog Ideas Generator – This will give you a range of catchy blog titles based on 3 nouns/subjects.
       The Grammarly Editor – Our free editing software offers you a second set of eyes to help catch errors and improve the effectiveness of your writing.
       Coach.me Digital Coaching – This useful tool has a dedicated track for writers, giving you a digital coach who will hold you accountable to write each day.
       There’s nothing wrong with using a sentence generator to spark a creative piece or relying on a friend to give feedback on the final product. Use technology and your network to your advantage.</p>

       <h3>Step 3: Break Down the Greater Goal into Small Tasks</h3><br>
       <p>Writing a 4,000-word summary of a book can seem intimidating. But does writing four 1,000-word sections sound as bad?
       Breaking down your greater goal into smaller, more manageable tasks will make it much easier to get the job done.
       Take, for example, the freelancing platform, Upwork. When writers accept a large, daunting task—like copyediting a full-length manuscript—they can choose to complete the task all at once or in “milestones.”
       Next time you’re slow to write, try splitting up your task into milestones. Write four hundred words per day. Or, write for one hour every morning from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 a.m. Trust us: you’ll feel proud of yourself for checking off a task each day.

       <div class="content">
       <h3>Step 4: Get Rid of What’s Distracting You</h3>
       <p>At any given moment, you face a whole slew of distractions: a new email, a text message, or a Snapchat from a friend. It’s hard to ignore notifications—so hard, in fact, that researchers have found a connection between procrastination and internet use with an inability to ‘create flow’ or feel absorbed in tasks.
       If you find yourself constantly distracted while you write, try using one of these tools to stay focused:
       Procraster – Ever wondered why you’re putting something off? Procraster gets to the psychological root of your distraction.
       Freedom – This app allows you to block any apps or websites that interfere with your writing.
       SelfControl – A more intense version of Freedom, this app lets you block anything that distracts you for a set period of time. You won’t be able to access what you’ve blocked until that time’s up—even if you disable the app.

          How do i obtain approval to register for a course that has restricted

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          You may need to obtain a permission number, which is a code used to
          override an enrollment restriction on a course. This code is issued by
          the school or department offering the course. The School of Education
          has an online form that students may use to request a permission code.
          For questions regarding permission codes, please email
          SOErecords@pitt.edu.

        <div class="label">How do i decide which cources to take?</div>
        <div class="content">
          Some programs, such as the PreK-4 and MAT teacher certification
          programs, have a structured, predetermined course schedule. However,
          others are much more flexible. If at any time you have a question
          regarding which course(s) you should be taking, please consult with
          your academic advisor. He or she will create a plan of studies with
          you, identifying courses that will satisfy requirements or elective
          credit for your specific academic program.

      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="label">How do i submit an application?</div>
        <div class="content">
          General information on how to apply can be found here. To submit an
          application, you can access the school's online application system.
          After creating a user account, you may continually login to work on
          your application prior to officially submitting it for admission
          consideration.

        <div class="label">Can a Institute remove a course from its selected list? </div>
        <div class="content">
          No. the institutes should be very careful while selecting the courses because if once
selected there is no provision to remove that course and there are chances that the
student may apply wrongly against that course.
